</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 1/2 pound tomahawk rib eye steak</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Remove steak from refrigerator and let stand at room temperature 30 minutes to an hour before cooking.
    </li>
    <li>
        Preheat the grill to medium-high, 400 to 450 degrees F (200 to 230 degrees C). Sprinkle steak evenly and liberally on all sides with salt and black pepper. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Lightly coat grill grates with oil or grilling spray. Place steak on hot grates, and grill, undisturbed, until it releases easily from the grates, about 4 minutes. Flip, and repeat on the other side. Continue grilling, turning occasionally, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of steak registers 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), 30 to 40 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transfer steak to a cutting board; let rest 15 minutes. Run a knife along the inside edge of the bone to remove steak from the bone in 1 piece; slice against the grain to serve.
    </li>
